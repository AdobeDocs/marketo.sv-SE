## Announcements {#announcements}

**** At that point, Marketo Engage user email addresses will require verification and uniqueness (this does not apply to API-only users). Directory service authenticated users will automatically have their emails verified when their subscription is enabled with Email Verification.

Email Verification for subscriptions using the “Login in Invite User Dialog” feature or that have a single email associated with multiple users will coincide with the May release. Subscriptions that have a single email associated with multiple users will be enabled with Email Verification and will require those users to resolve the conflict and use a unique email per user. When the ‘Login in Invite User Dialog’ feature is enabled, users invited via this feature will need to have a unique email address. For API-only users invited via this feature, the email address does not need to be unique.

**** Menu options for creating new assets will be hidden for all assets. [](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-discussions/archive-folder-change-in-may-2022-release/m-p/324369#M183235)
