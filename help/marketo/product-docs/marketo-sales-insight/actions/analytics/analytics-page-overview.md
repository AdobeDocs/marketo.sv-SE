# Analytics Page Overview {#analytics-page-overview}

The Analytics tab is where you see data regarding your emails&#39; engagement. Both individual and team data are displayed. Admins can also filter by the user on the Me tab.

## How Often Does it Update? {#how-often-does-it-update}

The analytics page updates every ten minutes.

## What Do the Numbers Mean? {#what-do-the-numbers-mean}

The numbers within the radials are calculating the total number of events on all emails sent. So if a single same email is viewed five times, it will add five views to this number. The same idea is applied to the clicks and replies counted inside the circle.

All of our stats kept inside the table will be calculated by looking at the unique views, clicks, and replies to your emails. If one email is viewed five times, we will count that as one view. That&#39;s why you may see a big difference in the numbers in the tables versus the numbers in the radial.

## Analytic Tabs {#analytic-tabs}

We break your stats into three separate tabs: Me, Team, and Content. You can use each one to get a different perspective on the insight we provide.

When going from tab to tab on the analytics page you can sort your stats by clicking on the view, click, or reply icons.

In the Me and Team tabs you will see information about deals closed. This number is controlled by how many times people on your team ring the gong.

## Me Tab {#me-tab}

[](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/actions/analytics/understanding-the-me-tab.md) If you&#39;re an admin in Sales Insight Actions, you can filter by any user on your team to see their stats.

## Team Tab {#team-tab}

[](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/actions/analytics/understanding-the-team-tab.md) You can also filter by any subteams you have created.

## Content Tab {#content-tab}

[](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/actions/analytics/understanding-the-content-tab.md) You can either filter by everyone, or by teams your admins have created.

If you see blue text under the subject column, it means the template is shared. You can click the blue text to be taken to that template. ****

&quot;Clicks on content&quot; are counted when a recipient clicks a link in your email.
